#*R-Ladies Sydney Basic R markdown Tutorial

- R markdown is a distinct type of R object that you can create using the File-New R Markdown feature in R Studio. 
- Once you save it, you get a default template based on the cars dataret which is packaged with R studio. You can then edit this section out.
- You can use the RStudio ** Knit ** button to render the resulting *.RMD file.
- You need to separate your entries by a newline or a space

# Headings use the "#"  tag
# Heading 1
## heading2
### heading3
#### etc...

#bold and italics using asterisks

For **bold use two asterisks**

For Italics, *use 1*

#Make bullet points with the *dash* (**_**). Make sure there's a space after the dash

- hello
-- this is indented, I wanted two indents, only got one
- - this is also indented
- - - even more indents

# Get quotes using the < and >

>"Note that **NO** space is needed"  *Bruce Thomas*

##### Note that backticks ``` can be used to rep[resent the embed code as text for this example
